##What the what?

The [Griffin Powermate](http://store.griffintechnology.com/powermate) is a handy knob/button controller useful for many applications. Griffin provides driver software for all major operating systems, but the hardware is simple enough to write your own drivers for. This project is intended to provide at least one example of a custom driver with a terminal client.
